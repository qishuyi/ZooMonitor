### **Goals**

1. **Work with the Cattle data and answer the client's questions regarding the animal**
    + Measured by the creation of visualizations to send to the client
2. **Work with another animal's data and answer the clientâ€™s questions regarding the animal**
    + Measured by the creation of visualizations to send to the client
3. **Explore the differences in the structure of the animal datasets that we currently have.**
    + Measured by the ability to articulate the differences during the next debriefing
4. **Create a prototype R Shiny program for only the Painted African Dogs, Cattles, and the other animal** 
    + Measured by a live demonstration during the next debriefing

\

### **Meeting with the Client**
We had our 3rd meeting with Anna on 3/18/2020 (Wednesday) to show some visuals and to interview her about the program.

#### **Plots** 
* We showed her 25 plots that answer her questions about Painted African Dogs, Cattles, and Squirrel Monkeys. (These plots include the ones we have already presented in our last debriefing)
* This part of the meeting was mainly about the clarification of the plots.
 
#### **Program** 
* We then asked her about her expectations for our final product, a program that will address all animals. Even though we had asked the same thing before, when we only had shown her some general plots, since we had created a wider variety of plots than then, we were curious if she had different ideas in mind. 

* Last time, she requested the three plots that we sent her at the first meeting (2/6) to be in the program:
  + Behaviors throught the day (Frequency & Proportion)
  + Activeness throught the week (Frequency)
  + Proportion of the behavior "Others" within all inactive behaviors

* We suggested that we create the input sections in the program so that the user can choose a factor by which they facet the data, e.g., day of week, time of day, animal's name, etc.
* She agreed on this suggestion and requested that we put some more detailed plots into the program, e.g., distribution of their observations, shift in animals' behaviors after a certain event, etc.

#### **Post Meeting**  

* Based on our client's request, we finalized the plots and choices of inputs we put in the prototype program:
  + Distribution of observations (by day of week/time of day/individual's name)
  + Percentage of a Behavior/Behaviors of users' choice per each individual animal
  + Percentage of a *Behavior Category/Behavior Categories of users' choice per each individual animal
  + Percentage of Behaviors before/after a certain event, e.g., death of the baby JT (in the Painted African Dogs' case)
  
*Behavior Category is a variable that groups some similar behaviors.
  
\

*Specific details regarding the program will be provided under Goal 4.* 

### **Goal 1**

***Visuals for Cattle***

\

#### **Agonistic Behaviors**
*How often are they showing Agonistic behaviors?*

\

#### **Stereotypic Behaviors**
*How often are they showing Stereoptypic behaviors?*

\

#### **Active vs. Inactive Behaviors**
*Are they spending more of their day active or inactive?*

```

* Green = Active, Red = Inactive

\

* Cattles generally spend more actively around 10am and 11am and more inactively after lunch time
* All individuals behave similarly throuout the day
* Significantly few observations at 12pm and 4pm, as in the Painted African Dogs' case

\

#### **Positive Behaviors**
*Is there one animal that spends more time doing the positive behaviors (Enrichment-based, Maintenance, Social, Locomotion)?*

\

### **Goal 2**

***Visuals for Squirrel Monkeys***

\

#### **Aggressive Behaviors**
*Is it one squirrel monkey being aggressive to all the others or is it one being picked on regularly?*


\

#### **Headspin**
*Which animal is doing headspins and how often?*


\

#### **Impact of Events on Behaviors**
*Did the deaths of Damian and Pistachio have an impact on the monkeys' behaviors?*

*Did the addition of Squirt have an impact on the monkeys' behaviors?*

* Deaths/Joining information
  + Damian passed away on Feb 22, 2018,
  + Pistachio passed away on Dec 3, 2018
  + Squirt came to the zoo on June 13, 2019
* Included the raw counts of observations since they normally differ significantly between before/after
* Only Damian has the period "One month after" since only he had observations soon after his death.
* We also created the same plots for Painted African Dogs' death/birth and sent them to our client since it was one of her initial interests. 

\

* We see a larger proportion of "Sitting" after a certain event, but not clear what this explains.

### **Goal 3**

***Comparison among animal datasets***


### **Goal 4**

***R Shiny app Prototype***

##link to it

\

### **Reflection and Discussion**

\

#### **Progress Reflection**

**1. Things that went well**

* Effective work distribution (using Trello)
* Effective use of R documents; we created an individual, but shared, R scripts to avoid the possible merge conflicts on Github
* Creation of the visuals
  + 25 visuals (Including some created for Debriefing #2) were sent to our client
  + She liked the plots and commented on some of them; expecially, she mentioned that the weather/temperature data would not be too useful since those two factors might be different from those at the recorded place (Pueblo Airport)
* Creation of the generalized cleaning script
  + Created a script that is compatible with any animal's dataset
  + This script takes the differences among the datasets into account and cleans any dataset in the same way 
* Meeting with our client 
  + She told us her more specific preferences on the plots that would possibly be included in the program than the last meeting
  + We were able to envision the program soon after the meeting and decide the plots and inputs for each plot 

**2. Things that were difficult**

* Plot creations
  + It took time to figure out how to deal with the cases with extremely few observations
  + Ended up creating a table for those ones
* Pie chart aesthetics
  + We had to choose between making the colors of the slice distinct to each other and sorting the slices by size (proportion)
  + Ended up making the colors of the slice distinct to each other and putting the largest slice at the beginning
