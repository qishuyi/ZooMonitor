### **Goals**

1. **Explore potential associations between the dogs’ behavior and external factors such as weather, temperature, events and food**
    + Measured by the creation of multiple visualizations
2. **Inform the client about the data cleaning procedure**
    + Measured by the creation of an R markdown file to send to the client
3. **Fulfill the client’s request to create/modify new or existing visualizations**
    + Measured by the creation of an updated Figure 1 based on 6-month intervals and the creation of a bar plot that displays the distribution of observations based on the day of week/time of day
4. **Investigate the possibility of creating the requested program** 
    + Measured by the ability to articulate the pros, cons, and alternative means

\

### **Meeting with the Client**
* Had our 2nd meeting with Anna on 2/19/2020 (Wednesday)
* To interview our client and set goals based on her needs

\

#### **Questions**  
  + Level of technology and whether they want to use R (data cleaning procedure report)
  + Format of the instruction document (Google Docs or R markdown)  
  + Expectation for the program (Visuals etc. )  
  + How many/which animals in the program?  
  + Data structure consistency  
  + Data storage    

\

#### **Answers**  
  + Unfamiliar with the data analysis tools/technologies beyond Excel  
    + Willing to adopt R as a way to clean data in the future  
  + R markdown with both codes and an instruction  
  + Three plots that we created:  
    + Active vs. Inactive proportion throughout the week  
    + Behavior frequencies throughout the day  
    + Proportion of the inactive behaviors  
  + Ideally all animals (45 species)  
  + The data structure is fundamentally the same
    + There could be more columns depending on the animal's activeness
  + ZooMonitor (not too troublesome to transfer the data to Google Drive)

\

#### **Post meeting**  
-> Received data on cattles -> figured out that the format of the datasets differed between cattle and P.A.D.

\

### **Data**

\

#### **Cleaning** 

Cleaned through the shared cleaning script (Only the basic cleaning procedure)

**Data Dictionary as of two weeks ago** 

![](Initial_dd.png)

\

#### **Column Additions**  

Column additions script (six column additions at once)  

**Added columns** 

![](Column_addition_dd.png)

\

#### **Weather/Temperature Data**
Data obtained from *NOAA*

  + Recorded at the Pueblo Airport, which is 15 min away from the zoo
  
  + Main variables: date, average/max/min temperature, and (abnormal) weather types
  
  + Limits  
    + Absence of the normal weathers such as sunny and rainy 
    + A good portion of observed days had missing entries in  those weather types, and some days had multiple weather types simultaneously  
    + Temperature of the recorded time didn't make sense  

\

#### **Food**

* Created a food column for the data set
* A relabeling of the day of week column
* Used to create visuals associated with Goal 1

\


### **Goal 1**

\

#### **Visual for Weather**

* Merging Data
  + Reduced weather types from 11 to 4 due to the absence of cases
    + Fog  
    + Thunder  
    + Hail  
    + Smoke or haze  
  + 2/3 of the observations had no record of any of these abnormal weather types 
  + Reclassified and created a column of weather types so that they include all existing combinations (Weather Type Reference)

```{r Visual for Weather}
#################### Association Between Dogs' Behavior with Weather
dogs_data_grouped3 <- group_by(dogs_data, Weather_Type, Activeness)

```

\

#### **Visuals for Temperature**
Using the **average of the average temp. and maximum temp.**

\

 **1. Categorical Temperature Level**

```{r Visual for Temperature Level, fig.width = 13, fig.height = 8}
dogs_data_grouped2 <- group_by(dogs_data, Activity,Temp_Level)
summary2 <- as.data.frame(summarise(dogs_data_grouped2, n()))
names(summary2)[names(summary2) == "n()"] <- "counts"
summary2 <- summary2 %>% group_by(Activity) %>%
  mutate(sum = sum(counts)) %>% 
  mutate(percent = counts/sum*100)
summary2$percent <- round(summary2$percent, digits = 1)
summary2 <- summary2 %>% mutate(percent_sub = paste(percent, "%"))

##Activity by Temperature Level Plot (TAVG_TMAX_avg)
ggplot(data = summary2, aes(x = Temp_Level, y = counts, fill = Temp_Level), show.legend = FALSE) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position=position_dodge()) + 
  facet_grid(.~ Activity) +
  labs(title = "Activity Based on Temperature Level", subtitle = "with Temperature Grouped into 10 Levels", x = "Temperature", y="Counts", fill = "Temperature Level") 

```

\

```{r Visual for Temperature Level Reference}
#Temperature Level Reference Table (TAVG_TMAX_avg)
Temp_Level_Reference <- as.data.frame(quantile(dogs_data$TAVG_TMAX_avg, 0:10/10))
names(Temp_Level_Reference)[names(Temp_Level_Reference) == "quantile(dogs_data$TAVG_TMAX_avg, 0:10/10)"] <- "Temperature (Fº)"
Temp_Level_Reference$`Temperature (Fº)` <- round(Temp_Level_Reference$`Temperature (Fº)`)
Temp_Level_Reference[1, 1] = "34 ~ 40"
Temp_Level_Reference[2, 1] = "41 ~ 45"
Temp_Level_Reference[3, 1] = "46 ~ 53"
Temp_Level_Reference[4, 1] = "54 ~ 59"
Temp_Level_Reference[5, 1] = "60 ~ 65"
Temp_Level_Reference[6, 1] = "66 ~ 69"
Temp_Level_Reference[7, 1] = "70 ~ 77"
Temp_Level_Reference[8, 1] = "78 ~ 81"
Temp_Level_Reference[9, 1] = "82 ~ 85"
Temp_Level_Reference[10, 1] = "86 ~ 94"
Temp_Level_Reference <- slice(Temp_Level_Reference, 1:10)
Temp_Level_Reference <- mutate(Temp_Level_Reference, Percent = rownames(Temp_Level_Reference))
Temp_Level_Reference <- mutate(Temp_Level_Reference, Level = rownames(Temp_Level_Reference))
Temp_Level_Reference <- Temp_Level_Reference %>% select(-Percent) 
Temp_Level_Reference <- Temp_Level_Reference[, c(2, 1)]
formattable(Temp_Level_Reference, align = c("l", "r"))
```


* Out of view → extreme temperatures
* Running → low temperatures
* Sleeping → high temperatures
  
\

 **2. Continuous Temperature (Violin)**
 
```{r Visual for Continuous temperature (violin)}
dogs_data_sub <- dogs_data %>% filter(!(Activity == "Eating" | Activity == "Dog Int" | Activity == "Object Int"))

##Activity by Numeric Temperature Plot(Violin)
ggplot(dogs_data_sub, aes(x = Activity, y = TAVG_TMAX_avg)) +
  geom_violin() +
  labs(title = "Activity Based on Temperature", subtitle = "with Continuous Temperature", x = "Activity", y = "Temperature (F°)")
```
 


* Removed "Eating," "Interaction with Objects," and "Interaction with dogs"
* Width showing the rough density
* Running → low temperatures
* Sleeping → high temperatures

\

 **3. Continuous Temperature (beeswarm)**
 
```{r Visual for continuous temperature (beeswarm)}
ggplot(dogs_data, aes(x = TAVG_TMAX_avg, y = Activity, color = Activity)) +
  geom_quasirandom(groupOnX=FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Activity Based on Temperature", subtitle = "with Continuous Temperature", x = "Temperature (F°)", y = "Activity")

```
 

* Shows the actual counts
* Lets us confirm the tendencies in sleeping/running

\

#### **Visuals for Food**

```






* Dogs were fed different types of food throughout the week
    + Ground Meat: Monday/Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday (n = 2484)
    + Bones: Wednesday/Sunday (n = 681)  
    
* Controlled for the time of day by faceting
* Second plot omits observations all Saturday observations (n = 811 for Ground Meat)
    + A LOT of resting observations on Saturday mornings
* Less activity in the morning on bone days 
* No major differences besides 1PM and 2PM

\

#### **Visuals for events**

\





* Two type of events: Brew at the Zoo, Zoo boo
    + Brew at the Zoo: beer event (2019/04/27)  
    + Zoo boo: Halloween event (2019/10/26)  
* Bring a high volume of visitors
* Investigate whether dogs' behave differently on the days of events
* Controlled for year, season, day of week, time of day
    + Compare days w/ and w/o events in similar contexts
    + Eliminate the effect of the relatively small number of observations between 2018/03/01 and 2019/03/01 (will discuss in Goal 3)
    + Eliminate the effect of seasonal differences
    + Eliminate the effect of the large number of observations on Saturdays (will discuss in Goal 3)
    + Observations on the days of events only recorded between 10:00~10:59am for Brew at the Zoo, between 9:00am~9:59am for Zoo boo




\

**Brew at the Zoo**

```{r Visual for Events (Brew at the Zoo), fig.width = 10, fig.height=4}
################## Association B/W Events and Dog Behavior
## Brew at the zoo (2019/4/27)
spring_sat_2019_data <- dogs_data %>% 
  filter (Season == "Spring", Year == 2019, Day_of_Week == "Sat", Hour == 10) %>%
  mutate(Events = ifelse(is.na(Notes), "No event", Notes))

spring_percentage_dog <- spring_sat_2019_data %>% 
  group_by(Name, Events, Activity) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  mutate(Percentage = n/sum(n)*100)

ggplot(data=spring_percentage_dog, aes(x=Events, y=Percentage, fill=Activity)) + 
  geom_col(position = "stack", width = 0.4) + 
  labs(title = "Percentage of behaviors on Saturdays in spring 2019 between 10:00~10:59am", x = "Events", y = "Percentage") +
  facet_grid(. ~ Name) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("khaki", "coral","cornflowerblue", "darkolivegreen3", "darkorchid1", "darkcyan"))
```

\

**Zoo boo**

```{r Visual for Events (Zoo boo), fig.width = 10, fig.height=4}
################## Association B/W Events and Dog Behavior
## Zoo boo (2019/10/26)
fall_sat_2019_data <- dogs_data %>% 
  filter (Season == "Fall", Year == 2019, Day_of_Week == "Sat", Hour == 9) %>%
  mutate(Events = ifelse(is.na(Notes), "No event", Notes))

fall_percentage_dog <- fall_sat_2019_data %>% 
  group_by(Name, Events, Activity) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  mutate(Percentage = n/sum(n)*100)

ggplot(data=fall_percentage_dog, aes(x=Events, y=Percentage, fill=Activity)) +

  labs(title = "Percentage of behaviors on Saturdays in fall 2019 between 9:00~9:59am", x = "Events", y = "Percentage") +
  facet_grid(. ~ Name) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("khaki", "coral","cornflowerblue", "darkolivegreen3", "darkorchid1", "darkcyan", "aquamarine", "mediumvioletred"))
```

\


* Most dogs are resting or alert when there is an event, while on the days without events they have more varied behaviors
* Akilah showed a stereotypically negative behavior on the day of Zoo boo
    + Walking -> pacing (usually a sign of anxiety)
* JT, the puppy, was always alert on the days of events

\

### **Goal 3**

\

#### **Figure 1**

```{r Visual for active/inactive behaviors in six-month intervals}
## Calculate percentage for each inactive behavior within each six-month interval
inactive_obs <- dogs_data %>% 
  filter(Activeness == 'Inactive') %>% 
  group_by(Six_Month_Interval, Activity) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  mutate(Percentage = n/sum(n)*100)

inactive_obs2 <- dogs_data %>% filter(Activeness == "Inactive")

## Inactive + stacked barplot + frequency
inactive_frequency <- ggplot(data=inactive_obs2) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x=Activity), fill = "coral", alpha = 0.7) + 
  labs(title = "Frequency of recorded inactive behaviors (in 6-month intervals)", x = "Dogs' behavior when inactive", y = "Frequency") +

  scale_fill_manual(values = c("coral","cornflowerblue", "darkolivegreen3", "darkorchid1", "darkcyan"))

grid.arrange(inactive_frequency, inactive_percentage, nrow = 2)
```

\


* First debriefing: plot for frequencies of different types of inactive behaviors
* Plot for inactiveness in six-month intervals
* The total number of observations between 2019-03-01 and 2020-01-11 is significantly higher with the majority of observations being ‘Resting’
* Uneven distribution of observations across intervals


\

```


* Unequal representation of certain days and times of the day
* Horizontal line represents percentage of observations under equal representation
* Day of Week Plot
    + Most observations on Saturdays (Over 50%)
    + Least observations on Fridays
* Time of Day Plot
    + More observations recorded at 9AM, 10AM and 2PM 
    + Less observations recorded at 12PM and 4PM

\


### **Goal 4**


\


* RShiny (deployed to shinyapps.io):
    + End user can upload data to the app (32MB max)
    + Googledrive package to pull data from a Google Drive
* Tableau (dashboard app/data visualization platform)
    + Faster rendering of visualizations
    + Slow data wrangling with limited packages
    + Drag-and-drop functionality
        + Unable to redo data cleaning process or recreate visualizations from scripts
    + Expensive ($70/user/month)
* Shiny
    + Faster and easier data wrangling (considerably more packages than Tableau)
    + Good for a large number of visualizations
    + Dynamic rendering of visualization
* Excel add-in for data cleaning (not sufficient for the higher-level cleaning we want to do)
* Python
    + Lots of learning -> lower quality of the product
    + Deployment issues


\

\

### **Reflection and Discussion**

\

#### **Progress Reflection**

**1. Things that went well**

* Effective work distribution (using Trello)
* Creation of visuals
* Creation of the document
* Meeting with our client 

**2. Things that were difficult**

* Github issue (as editing simultaneously)
* A  difficulty explaining technical topics to our client
* Finding a usable weather/temperature dataset

\

#### **Goal Reflection**

1. Explore associations between dogs’ behavior and external factors $\rightarrow$ **Complete**
    + We created visualizations for four different external factors
2. Inform the client about the data cleaning procedure $\rightarrow$ **Complete**
    + We created and sent a comprehensive document to the client
3. Fulfill the client’s request to create/modify new or existing visualizations $\rightarrow$ **Complete**
    + Created two plots illustrating:
        + The frequency of inactive behaviors in 6 month intervals
        + The percentage of observations per day of week, and time of day
    + We sent the client a progress report which includes these visuals
4. Investigate the possibility of creating the requested program  $\rightarrow$ **Complete**
    + We researched the pros and cons of potential tools and presented the findings 


* Feasible, but was a much heavier load than the previous debriefing
* Some goals were time consuming, others not as much
* Efficient distribution of various tasks helped us meet all of our goals

\

#### **Next Steps**

\

* Understand and clean the cattle dataset
    + More categories for active behaviors (i.e., agonistic, locomotion, social, stereotypic)
* Answer client’s questions about cattle behavior
    + How often are they showing Agonistic behaviors?
    + How often are Stereotypic behaviors occurring?
    + Are they spending more of their day active or inactive?
    + Is there one animal that spends more time doing the positive behaviors (Enrichment-based, Maintenance, Social, Locomotion)?
* Continue with the planning/investigation stages of the program
