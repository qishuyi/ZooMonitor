#### **Goals**

\

\

\

#### **Meeting with the Client**


\

##### **Questions**  
  + Level of technology and whether they want to use R (data cleaning procedure report)
  + Format of the instruction document (Google Docs or R markdown)  
  + Expectation for the program (Visuals etc. )  
  + How many/which animals in the program?  
  + Data structure consistency  
  + Data storage    

\

##### **Answers**  
  + Unfamiliar with the data analysis tools/technologies beyond Excel  
    + Willing to adopt R as a way to clean data in the future  
  + R markdown with both codes and an instruction  
  + Three plots that we created:  
    + Active vs. Inactive proportion throughout the week  
    + Behavior frequencies throughout the day  
    + Proportion of the inactive behaviors  
  + Ideally all animals (45 species)  
  + The data structure is fundamentally the same
    + There could be more columns depending on the animal's activeness
  + ZooMonitor (not too troublesome to transfer the data to Google Drive)

#### **Data**
##### **Cleaning** (recap)  
Cleaned through the shared cleaning script (Only the basic cleaning procedure)

**Data Dictionary as of two weeks ago**

**Column Additions**

**Data Dictionary as of now**

\

##### **Weather/Temperature Data**
Data obtained from *NOAA*

  + Recorded at the Pueblo Airport, which is 15 min away from the zoo
  
  + Main variables: date, average/max/min temperature, and (abnormal) weather types
  
  + Limits  
    + Absence of the normal weathers such as sunny and rainy 
    + A good portion of observed days had missing entries in  those weather types, and some days had multiple weather types simultaneously  
    + Temperature of the recorded time didn't make sense
