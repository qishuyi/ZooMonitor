**Introduction**

R is a programming language that enables users to write programs to perform data analysis and create data visualizations.

R Studio is a programming environment where we write R programs and execute them.

R/R Studio simplifies and automates the process of data cleaning and manipulation without the user directly interacting with a dataset. For instance, in Excel, users might need to go through the entire file to delete rows with incomplete data values while in R it can be done with one line of code.

R also allows users to perform higher-level data cleaning and manipulation with the packages it provides. For example, we can create a new column, 'day of week' (Mon, Tue, Wed, etc.), based on the existing 'date' column (YYYY-MM-DD) in the dataset. The creation of new columns can also be done with one line of code, instead of us manually going through each row to calculate and add the values. 

Our data cleaning process was directed by a few end goals we had regarding the final dataset. Firstly, we want the dataset to only contain columns that are helpful for our data analysis and visualization. Some columns in the dataset are auto-generated by the ZooMonitor system and do not provide relevant information to studying the behaviors of dogs (i.e., 'image_size'). Eventually, we hope to have a smallest set of variables that still enables us to perform effective analysis on the dataset. Secondly, we would like the column names to be simple yet without loss of information. Some variable names like 'Interval_Channel_1_Value' are too long and too hard to work with. In the cleaned dataset, we would want all variable names to be relatively short but still provides sufficient information about the meaning of the variables. Thirdly, some rows in the raw dataset contain both active and inactive behaviors while some rows contain neither active nor inactive behaviors. To facilitate the visualization process, each row in the final dataset needs to contain only one type of behavior, either active or inactive. 

To achieve our end goals, we have gone through a few data cleaning steps. We started by importing the csv file into RStudio, which allows us to use the R programming language to tidy and manipulate the dataset. We then removed the columns that are unnecessary for our data analysis and visualization, including the columns that are auto-generated by ZooMonitor and those that contain duplicated information. For instance, we eliminated the 'DateTime' column because there was already a 'Date' and a 'Time' column in the dataset. After that, we simplified some variable names, making them shorter and easier to work with. For example, we changed the variable name 'Interval_Channel_1_Value' to 'IC1_Value'. We still kept the names similar to their original format in case we want to change them back in the future. Last but not least, we removed the rows which contain neither active nor inactive behaviors, and splitted each row that contains both active and inactive behaviors into two rows. 

Moreover, we took a few additional steps to make the data easier to work with. Initially, the dataset contains a column which is 'Active' for observations that record active behaviors and is empty for those that record inactive behaviors. There is also such a column for 'Inactive'. We combined the two columns into one single column called 'Activeness' and the new column contains two types of values, 'Active' and 'Inactive'. In response to the combination of the two columns, we also combined the two columns for different types of active and inactive behaviors into one called "Activity".

#### **Data Cleaning Procedure**

\

##### **Installing Packages**

\

\

##### **Loading in Libraries**

\

\

##### **Importing Data**

\

\


##### **Inspecting the Data**

We have successfully installed necessary packages, loaded the libraries, and imported our data. Before beginning the data cleaning process, we must inspect the data. We begin by checking the number of rows the columns the data contains.

```{r}
dim(dogs_data)
```
We used the *dim()* function, and passed in the name of the data frame as the argument. The values that the function returned suggest that the raw data consists of 3409 observations and 25 different columns. 


\

Now, we will inspect the entire data frame. The *view()* function can be used to examine the entire data frame. Other functions such as *head()* and *tail()* can be used to examine the first or last couple of rows of the data frame, respectively. 

```{r, eval = F}
view(dogs_data)
head(dogs_data)
tails(dog_data)
```

\

Upon carefully exploration of the data, we compiled a list of actions to take in order to make the data easier to work with. 

- Remove columns that don't contain any useful information.
- Change some of the column names to make it easier to work with.
- Remove rows that don't contain any behavioral observations for the dog.
- Split rows that contain multiple behavioral observation.

\

##### **Removing Irrelevant Columns **

From here, we will finally begin the process of data cleaning. We will first remove columns that don't contain useful information for the purposes of anayzing the data. For the data on Painted African Dogs, we decided to remove the following columns:

- *Confirguration Name*
- *Observer*
- *Device ID*
- *DataTime*
- *Grid Size*
- *Image Size*
- *Channel Type*
- *Project Animals*
- *Duration*

\

To remove these columns, we will use the *select()* function from the dplyr package. This function will allow us to select columns we want to keep in the data frame, or alternatively select columns we want to remove from the data frame. In our case, there are more columns we want to keep than remove, so we will pursue the latter option. 

```{r}
dogs_data <- select(dogs_data, -`Configuration Name`, -Observer,-DeviceID,
                                  -DateTime, -`Grid Size`, -`Image Size`,-`Channel Type`,
                                  -`Project Animals`, -Duration) 

```

\

The first argument of the *select()* function is the data frame name of our concern. Since we want to remove columns from the data frame called *dogs_data*, we passed dogs_data as the first argument. Now, we want to pass in all the names of the columns we want to remove as arguments, separated by commas. In addition, we need to make sure to include a minus sign (-) infront of the column name to indicate that we want to remove these columns. Note that all column names consisting of two different words (I.e *Configuration Name*) must be sandwiched between **`**. These types of column names are tiresome to work with, and is partly the focus of the next section where we work on renaming column names. Lastly, we reassign the modified data frame back to *dogs_data*. Thus, *dogs_data* is now the modified version of the original data frame, containing everything besides the columns we removed above. 

\

Before moving on, we check to make sure that the columns were actually removed. A quick method is to check for the number of columns in the modified version of the data frame. Since we removed 9 columns from the original 25, we should be left with 16 columns. To do this, we can use the *ncol()* function, and pass in the name of the data frame as the argument. 

```{r}
ncol(dogs_data)
```

\

Since the function returned a value of 16, it appears as though the columns were removed correctly. However, there is always a case in which we refered to the wrong column name, or accidentally removed a column that we intended to keep. Since there are only a limited number of columns, we can use the *colnames()* function to check the names of all columns in the data frame. Again, we pass the name of the data frame as the argument.


```{r}
colnames(dogs_data)
```

\

The output suggests that all and only the columns we wished to remove were deleted from the data frame. While the two checks we performed above were not necessary, they can serve as a useful method for assuring that the columns were removed correctly.
