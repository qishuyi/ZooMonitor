#### **Introduction**

R is a programming language that enables users to write programs to perform data analysis and create data visualizations.

R Studio is a programming environment where we write R programs and execute them.

R/R Studio simplifies and automates the process of data cleaning and manipulation without the user directly interacting with a dataset. For instance, in Excel, users might need to go through the entire file to delete rows with incomplete data values while in R it can be done with one line of code.

R also allows users to perform higher-level data cleaning and manipulation with the packages it provides. For example, we can create a new column, 'day of week' (Mon, Tue, Wed, etc.), based on the existing 'date' column (YYYY-MM-DD) in the dataset. The creation of new columns can also be done with one line of code, instead of us manually going through each row to calculate and add the values. 

Our data cleaning process was directed by a few end goals we had regarding the final dataset. Firstly, we want the dataset to only contain columns that are helpful for our data analysis and visualization. Some columns in the dataset are auto-generated by the ZooMonitor system and do not provide relevant information to studying the behaviors of dogs (i.e., 'image_size'). Eventually, we hope to have a smallest set of variables that still enables us to perform effective analysis on the dataset. Secondly, we would like the column names to be simple yet without loss of information. Some variable names like 'Interval_Channel_1_Value' are too long and too hard to work with. In the cleaned dataset, we would want all variable names to be relatively short but still provides sufficient information about the meaning of the variables. Thirdly, some rows in the raw dataset contain both active and inactive behaviors while some rows contain neither active nor inactive behaviors. To facilitate the visualization process, each row in the final dataset needs to contain only one type of behavior, either active or inactive. 

To achieve our end goals, we have gone through a few data cleaning steps. We started by importing the csv file into RStudio, which allows us to use the R programming language to tidy and manipulate the dataset. We then removed the columns that are unnecessary for our data analysis and visualization, including the columns that are auto-generated by ZooMonitor and those that contain duplicated information. For instance, we eliminated the 'DateTime' column because there was already a 'Date' and a 'Time' column in the dataset. After that, we simplified some variable names, making them shorter and easier to work with. For example, we changed the variable name 'Interval_Channel_1_Value' to 'IC1_Value'. We still kept the names similar to their original format in case we want to change them back in the future. Last but not least, we removed the rows which contain neither active nor inactive behaviors, and splitted each row that contains both active and inactive behaviors into two rows. 

Moreover, we took a few additional steps to make the data easier to work with. Initially, the dataset contains a column which is 'Active' for observations that record active behaviors and is empty for those that record inactive behaviors. There is also such a column for 'Inactive'. We combined the two columns into one single column called 'Activeness' and the new column contains two types of values, 'Active' and 'Inactive'. In response to the combination of the two columns, we also combined the two columns for different types of active and inactive behaviors into one called "Activity".

#### **Data Cleaning Procedure**

\

##### **Installing Packages**

\

\

##### **Loading in Libraries**

\

\

##### **Importing Data**

\

\


##### **Inspecting the Data**

We have successfully installed necessary packages, loaded the libraries, and imported our data. Before beginning the data cleaning process, we must inspect the data. We begin by checking the number of rows the columns the data contains.

```{r}
dim(dogs_data)
```
We used the *dim()* function, and passed in the name of the data frame as the argument. The values that the function returned suggest that the raw data consists of 3409 observations and 25 different columns. 


\

Now, we will inspect the entire data frame. The *view()* function can be used to examine the entire data frame. Other functions such as *head()* and *tail()* can be used to examine the first or last couple of rows of the data frame, respectively. 

```{r, eval = F}
view(dogs_data)
head(dogs_data)
tails(dog_data)
```

\

Upon carefully exploration of the data, we compiled a list of actions to take in order to make the data easier to work with. 

- Remove columns that don't contain any useful information.
- Change some of the column names to make it easier to work with.
- Remove rows that don't contain any behavioral observations for the dog.
- Split rows that contain multiple behavioral observation.

\

##### **Removing Irrelevant Columns **

From here, we will finally begin the process of data cleaning. We will first remove columns that don't contain useful information for the purposes of anayzing the data. For the data on Painted African Dogs, we decided to remove the following columns:

- *Confirguration Name*
- *Observer*
- *Device ID*
- *DataTime*
- *Grid Size*
- *Image Size*
- *Channel Type*
- *Project Animals*
- *Duration*

\

To remove these columns, we will use the *select()* function from the dplyr package. This function will allow us to select columns we want to keep in the data frame, or alternatively select columns we want to remove from the data frame. In our case, there are more columns we want to keep than remove, so we will pursue the latter option. 

```{r}
dogs_data <- select(dogs_data, -`Configuration Name`, -Observer,-DeviceID,
                                  -DateTime, -`Grid Size`, -`Image Size`,-`Channel Type`,
                                  -`Project Animals`, -Duration) 

```

\

The first argument of the *select()* function is the data frame name of our concern. Since we want to remove columns from the data frame called *dogs_data*, we passed dogs_data as the first argument. Now, we want to pass in all the names of the columns we want to remove as arguments, separated by commas. In addition, we need to make sure to include a minus sign (-) infront of the column name to indicate that we want to remove these columns. Note that all column names consisting of two different words (I.e *Configuration Name*) must be sandwiched between **`**. These types of column names are tiresome to work with, and is the main focus of the next section where we work on renaming column names. Lastly, we reassign the modified data frame back to *dogs_data*. Thus, *dogs_data* is now the modified version of the original data frame, containing everything besides the columns we removed above. 

\

Before moving on, we check to make sure that the columns were properly removed. A quick method is to check for the number of columns in the modified version of the data frame. Since we removed 9 columns from the original 25, we should be left with 16 columns. To do this, we can use the *ncol()* function, and pass in the name of the data frame as the argument. 

```{r}
ncol(dogs_data)
```

\

Since the function returned a value of 16, it appears as though the columns were removed correctly. However, there is always a case in which we refered to the wrong column name, or accidentally removed a column that we intended to keep. Since there are only a limited number of columns, we can use the *colnames()* function to check the names of all columns in the data frame. Again, we pass the name of the data frame as the argument.


```{r}
colnames(dogs_data)
```

\

The output suggests that all and only the columns we wished to remove were deleted from the data frame. While the two checks we performed above were not necessary, they can serve as a useful method for assuring that the columns were removed correctly. 

\

##### **Renaming Columns **

Now, we will rename some of the column names to simplify process of analyzing the data. In general, shorter column names that still effectively depict the information it contains are the most convinient. As mentioned earlier, column names consisting of multiple words are inefficient and troublesome to work with. Through this process, our aim is to get rid of "spaces" in column names, as well as shorten them whenever appropriate. Upon examining the columns in the data set, we decided to make the following changes:


Old Column Name                       | New Column Name
--------------------------------------| ------------------
*Session Start Time*                  | *Session_Start_Time*
*Session End Time*                    | *Session_End_Time*
*Focal Name*                          | *Name*
*Interval Channel 1 Name*             | *IC1_Name*
*Interval Channel 1 Name*             | *IC1_Value*
*Interval Channel 1 Social Modifier*  | *IC1_Social_Modifier*
*Interval Channel 2 Name*             | *IC2_Name*
*Interval Channel 2 Value*            | *IC2_Value*

\

To make these changes, we will use the *rename()* function from the dplyr package. This function allows us to precisely specify and change the columns that we wish to rename. Some frequently used methods of removing spaces from column names include replacing spaces with periods marks or underscores. While will opt to use underscores, this choice is simply a matter of preference.

```{r}
dogs_data <-  rename(dogs_data, Session_Start_Time = `Session Start Time`,
                                  Session_End_Time = `Session End Time`, 
                                  Name = `Focal Name`,
                                  Frame_Number = `Frame Number`,
                                  IC1_Name = `Interval Channel 1 Name`,
                                  IC1_Value = `Interval Channel 1 Value`,
                                  IC1_Social_Modifier = `Interval Channel 1 Social Modifier`,
                                  IC2_Name = `Interval Channel 2 Name`,
                                  IC2_Value = `Interval Channel 2 Value`)
```

\

Like the *select()* function we deployed earlier, the first argument we must pass in the function is the name of the data frame. This informs the function of where the column names are coming from. The general syntax for the succeeding arguments is *new column name = current column name*. We can rename as many columns as desired, as long as each instance is separated with a comma. Again, we reassign the modified data back into *dogs_data*, so that it contains the updated column names. 

\

We can check to make sure that the column names were all changed properly. Again, we use the *colnames()* function to do this. 

```{r}
colnames(dogs_data)
```

\

The output is the list of column names in the modified dogs data. By inspection, we can be assured that all of the desired changes were applied correctly.

\

##### **Omitting Rows**

Prior to this point, we have manipulated our data such that it consists of only the columns we may need for future analysis, and renamed the column names for simplicity purposes. The next step, removing rows missing behavioral observations, is crucial to the data cleaning process. Handling missing data can be very time consuming when done manually. However, R provides a fast and efficient way of dealing with this issue. 

In the dogs data, behavioral observations are stored in two columns: *IC1_Value* and *IC2_Value*. Note that these are the renamed versions of Interval Channel 1 Value and Interval Channel 2 Value. We want to remove only the rows that are missing values for **both** of these columns. Later on, we will combine these two columns into a single column to make visualizing data simpler. For now, however, we must consider active and inactive behaviors as two separate columns. 

The *filter()* function from the dplyr package allows us to keep only a subset of rows we want from the data frame. Notice that removing rows that are missing values for **both** *IC1_Value* and *IC2_Value* is tantamount to keeping all rows that is **not** missing values for these two columns. 

```{r}
dogs_data <- filter(dogs_data, !(is.na(IC1_Value) & is.na(IC2_Value)))
```
\

Again, the first argument of the function specifies the data frame of our concern. The second argument is a little invovled, so we first will decompose and explain each part individually. The *is.na()* function esentially checks to see whether a value is missing. Hence, is.na(IC1_Value) is going through every row of the dogs data and checking whether there is a missing value in the *IC1_Value* column. is.na(IC2_Value) follows the exact same procedure, and verifies missing values in the *IC2_Value* column of the data frame. Combining these two expressions with **&**, we are now going through the data and checking for rows missing values for **both** columns. At this point, the function will keep all and only the rows with missing values for both *IC1_Value* and *IC2_Value*. By putting **!** infront of the expression, this will allow us to achieve our goal of keeping all and only the rows **not** missing values for the two columns. Lastly, we reassign the modified version of the data back to *dogs_data*. 

\

When we first inspected the initial data, there were a total of 3409 rows. We now check for the number of rows in our current data frame, after omitting rows missing behavioral observations. 

```{r}
nrow(dogs_data)
```
\

Our newly modified data frame has a total of 3173 rows. Hence, there were 236 rows with missing observations. Now that we have successfully handled rows with missing values, we will address rows with multiple behavioral observations in the following section.

We hope that this report was helpful for you! The introduction highlights some big picture ideas and the general process in which we cleaned the data. The later sections illustrate the technical more technical details, and provides explanations along the way. The data cleaning procedure covers the minimal necessary steps taken in order to create visualizations and analyze the data. While not explicitly presented in this document, there are a wide range of steps that can be taken to enrich the content of the data. The following are some additional modifications we have made using R to the dogs data as of February 27th 2020:

- Added a column for day of the week *(I.e Wednesday)*
- Added a column for food *(I.e Bones)*
- Added a column for season *(I.e. Summer)*
- Added a column for average temperature 
- Added a column for weather
